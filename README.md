   <h1>Lake Surface Water Evaporation Modeling with Remote Sensing and Hybrid Deep Learning</h1>
</div>


This repository supports a research study on estimating lake surface water evaporation using satellite-derived water quality (WQ) parameters and in-situ meteorological (MG) data. We develop Bayesian Optimization (BO)-tuned deep learning architectures (BO-LSTM, BO-GRU) and compare them with their non-optimized counterparts (LSTM, GRU) and a physically based Penman-FAO formulation (baseline).

> Status: Active research codebase (manuscript in preparation). Structure and APIs may change.

## Key Contributions

- Focus on open surface water evaporation.
- Integrates remote sensingâ€“derived WQ parameters (CHL, CDOM, TSM, temperature) with MG drivers.
- Hybrid deep learning: BO-LSTM and BO-GRU (Bayesian hyperparameter optimization).
- Benchmark against Penman-FAO physical model.
- Feature attribution using SHAP for interpretability.
- Demonstrates viability of WQ-only predictors where MG data are sparse.
